Hi!, Iâ€™m @JJSnakey

I study software development at Arizona State University!

My passion is to work with groups of people and accomplish their goals. 
Any project that involves collaboration is what I'm interested in.

In school I have began working with and creating projects with javaScript,
I am also currently working through The Odin Project to learn how to 
properly use and manage HTML, CSS, and gitHub.

My goal is to find an intership as well! I believe I learn better on the 
job but I am ready to study and create privately until I have the skills
necessary to be hireable. My current work experience involves 5 years in
team building and leadership roles, I like working with others!


If you have any inquiries, email me at QwertoBerto85@gmail.com ! 

I look forward to working with or for you :)
