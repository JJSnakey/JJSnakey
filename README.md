Hi!, My name is Joshua Greer @JJSnakey

I study software development at Arizona State University!

My passion is to work with groups of people and accomplish their goals. 
Any project that involves collaboration is what I'm interested in.

I have experience working with java, javaScript, Python, and C from the 
ASU Software Engineering program and Harvard CS50. I am currently
beginning my second semester at University for computer science, 
and I'm looking forward to expanding my portfolio.

Outside of comp sci, my work experience includes 5 years in team building
and leadership roles. I enjoy teaching and working alongside many unique
and talented people.


If you have any inquiries, email me at jjgreer@asu.edu ! 

I look forward to working with you :)
